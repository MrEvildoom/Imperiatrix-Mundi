(NO PICTURE)	That's you!

You are currently a first year student at Nagamioka Middle School and are working hard to build yourself an awesome magical girl harem team. Team. You definitely mean team, yes. Ahem.
Age: 13
Birthday: May 8th, 1997
Blood Type: B
Height: 154cm
Measurements: It's a secret♥
Overall Description: Adorable
Status: Tragically single... OTL
Favor-- ...okay, fine. You'll stop embellishing your character profile, geez.
Hair: Dark reddish-purple, down to mid-back, usually held back by a hair band
Eyes: Bright pink
Mood: Disappointed at not having a proper trivia-filled character profile like a real magical girl protagonist!!! Bah.
Heart: 6
Mind: 2
Will: 3

Axiom rule: Desires to help people and keep them safe, both physically and emotionally. Positive effects apply when comforting someone, rescuing people, or planning/attempting to do those; negative effects apply when hurting others even if it's the only option, or when seriously considering someone getting hurt because of her.
Inherent Abilities
 
Magic Perception: Yui can perceive magical power. She's not sure what all the details and differences mean, or whether she can see only certain kinds of magic, but she can recognize humans and barrier entrances. Large concentrations of power or anything at too much of a distance becomes an indistinct blur and all she can tell is roughly how much magic is present. Physical Boosts: Yui's wish gives her physical enhancements well above most magical girls. So far she's discovered that:
She can jump well over 30m straight up, and probably closer to 50m.
She can smash flying boulders with her face.
Magic Abilities


Shockwave: A light omnidirectional pulse of magic. Not very damaging, but will knock loose objects and people away from Yui. Costs 2-10 corruption depending on power level. Can break open a barrier entrance allowing non-magical girls to cross freely, because Yui apparently finds it easier to metaphorically kick down a Witch's door rather than figure out how the doorknob works...

Magic Beam: A narrow blast of raw magic, persisting for a few seconds. Makes simple inanimate objects explode, but anything containing its own magic will be sliced cleanly, if not blocking the beam entirely. Costs 2-10 corruption depending on power level.

Beam Spam: Dozens of simultaneous Magic Beam attacks at various angles and rotating in different directions. Covers a cone spanning 25 degrees or so. Small, agile, and/or distant targets may be able to dodge, but almost anything else will take at least a glancing blow. Costs 30-80 corruption, depending on power level.

Beam Cannon: A Magic Beam with more beam and way more magic. Anything without heavy magic shielding will be nigh-instantly vaporized. Costs 200-1000 corruption, depending on beam width, at roughly 1mm per point of corruption. Higher power levels would be possible, but at that point the beam is wider than Yui is tall and it becomes too hard to control. At full power, will destroy most Witches in a single shot.
Fancy Tricks and Interesting Possibilities


Power Grab: Yui seems to have some ability to take control of existing power in some abstract sense. The details and limits are unknown. So far she's successfully stolen a Witch's power to control Witch Kissed humans, an ability she intends to develop further even though using it feels really creepy.

        {slide=Maiko Sakue / 作栄 魔惟子}
(NO PICTURE)	Your super cool magical girl sempai who is gonna teach you how to be even more awesome than you already are! She's really smart and has been super helpful with all kinds of stuff. Her magic lets her look up all kinds of information which is probably why she kinda sounds like a know-it-all sometimes. You might feel bad about bugging her with lots of questions but you're pretty sure she enjoys explaining things to anyone who'll listen.

You kinda worry about her a little bit though. It seems like she was in a really bad place before you met her and while she seems okay now you're suspicious she's got a lot of pain and loneliness she's hiding.
Age: 20

Hair: Dusty green, around shoulder length. Looks like it hasn't been trimmed recently at all, pulled back into a rough ponytail.
Eyes: Hazel
Heart: 3
Mind: 6
Will: 4

Axiom rule: ???
Magic Abilities


Information Retrieval: Can obtain information about various topics. What kind of information and the means by which she does so are currently unknown. Corruption cost depends on what information she's after.

Iron Grave: Summons a swarm of magic chains out of nowhere to wrap and bind the target, immobilizing them. (1 MP)

???: Summons a large number of miniature magic forcefields in geometric shapes. Can be moved around independently, linked together into a single large wall, or formed into simple constructs she can control remotely. (1 MP)

???: Creates a swarm of flying sickle blades up to 25 meters away, which fly toward Maiko and disappear just before reaching her, or sooner if she prefers. (1 MP)

???: Temporary magic effect that allows controlled flight and levitation. (1 MP when transformed; 2 MP otherwise, or if used on someone else)

???: Temporary magic effect that allows limited control of raw destructive magic, either formed into a melee weapon attached to her hand or fired as projectiles. Destruction magic appears as a mixture of black smoke and green lightning. (1 MP when transformed; 2 MP otherwise)

(NO PICTURE)	A magical girl in south-east Nagamioka. Her territory borders yours to the northwest, Chiba prefecture to the east, and Tokyo's Adachi and Katsushika wards to the south. She was driven out of her home in Tokyo by a group there and planned to continue on to Yokohama or Kazamino, but decided to claim part of Nagamioka when the opportunity arrived.

She seems kinda prickly and stubborn and is reflexively distrustful of everything to the point of near paranoia. As frustrating as it was to talk to her, the worst part is that from what Maiko says about Tokyo she probably has good reasons for being the way she is...

Her costume looks like a stereotypical delinquent outfit with a decorative flower motif and she fights viciously with two spiked clubs. She also has some sort of magic that's probably related to plants because she could summon vines to trap a Witch... actually now that you think about it, those spikes on her clubs even looked like rose thorns. You wonder what else she can do...

(NO PICTURE)	Your best friend since childhood!

Natsuki is a total jock and really sweet and also kind of a crybaby. You worry about her sometimes, that she might be a little too emotionally dependent on you, but... she's your friend so it's not like you could abandon her when she needs support, right?

She's one of the best soccer players in the school and you love watching her games to see her in action. She gets a lot of attention from other girls in your class... you've caught a few jealous looks thrown your way which you think is totally unfair because you're just friends and also you're preeeetty sure Natsuki isn't into girls anyway on account of never once catching her checking out her teammates despite how awesome soccer shorts are.
Age: 13
Height: 165cm

        {slide=Asami Amano / 天野 朝望}
(NO PICTURE)	Another classmate. You don't know her all that well, but she hangs out with Natsuki a lot so you talk to her regularly.

Asami is a proud and driven girl with a chronically ornery and uncooperative temperament. Somehow ended up as the student council VP despite being the terror of authority figures everywhere and is surprisingly successful and well-liked for it. She's planning to run for student council president next year and you think she might just win.

Honestly, she's the one person you might feel a bit jealous of. Without any of your advantages she's done more than you ever have, and did so running on little more than ambition and sheer audacity. But she's Natsuki's friend and seems nice, so you can't really dislike her.

Anyway, she's cool and you definitely wouldn't mind getting to know her better. Ahem.

(NO PICTURE)	Your big brother. He's in his first year at a fancy university in another city and visits occasionally, maybe once a month or so.

The two of you have been very close for years. Your parents are nice people, but they tend to be strict, a bit old-fashioned, and more than a bit emotionally distant, so for most of your childhood your brother was the one who'd be there for you when you needed something.

When your parents started making disapproving faces at your precocious not-quite-teenage antics Kaoru often ended up "stuck" watching you in order to be a "good influence", which usually meant him aiding and abetting you and your friends in all manner of not-parentally-sanctioned shenanigans.

Basically he's a real bro, in every sense.

Kyubey ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
A strange and mysterious white creature with creepy soulless eyes who offers contracts to become a magical girl. Kinda sketchy.

His body is disturbingly stretchy...

Yumi Kaga
A magical girl from Tokyo on the run after stealing a stash of Grief Seeds from the group that killed most of her allies. She was hoping to hide somewhere in the prefecture outside the Tokyo metro area, but got caught in a fight with Koharu shortly after entering Nagamioka.

Chiharu Motomiya
The magical girl who killed Momoko Kisaragi's older sister. She probably had a traumatic childhood or something but that's no excuse for being such a horrible person.

Basically she's dead and even you have to admit she kinda had it coming.

Izumi Kaikyou
A girl with magic that controls water and gravity. She nearly died before being rescued by Maiko and Momoko.

You wonder what happened to her after that...

Ludum Machinae
that's "game mechanics" in very dubious Latin fyi

The first law of this quest: I AM THE LAW.

...by which I mean that gameplay mechanics exist to smooth things out and let you know what to expect. I will disregard them if necessary for the sake of common sense or a better narrative, but most of the rules will be loose enough in the first place that it probably won't be an issue. I may also ignore crunchy gameplay stuff entirely for scenes where I'm pretty sure the outcome would be the same regardless.

[tabs=Game Mechanics|100%x520]

    {slide=General Gameplay}[tabs=General Gameplay|100%x420]
{slide=Things What Happen}There are basically five types of decision that will come up in this quest:

Simple Fluff: The decisions you make will have minor long-term impact, mostly determining what happens in the next update, most of which will probably be silly.

Social Minefields: The decisions you make will have potentially large consequences for how you interact with the other characters involved in the future. What happens will be primarily a matter of whether you can figure out what the other characters want and are motivated by. Dice will be used rarely if at all, and only for things like "does the character have the courage and/or willpower to do what the vote says".

Combat: The decisions you make will, obviously, determine the outcome of the battle. Combat will generally be resolved narratively if a plan is provided that relies only on established abilities that have a guaranteed result. Combat that boils down to "hit bad girl with thing what makes ouchies" will probably be resolved with dice, as will attempts to use improvised techniques or ones that don't have a guaranteed outcome for other reasons.

Exploration and Training: The decisions you make will provide information or improve the character's abilities in various ways, but with no other immediate impact. Note that a character's skill at a task will improve if and only if the margin of success/failure was small--overwhelming failure or success won't teach the character anything about what works or not.

Long-term planning: When there are no immediate crises, you'll instead vote on high-level plans of what Yui and friends should do over a specified period of time. I'll explain this better once the Quest gets to the point where it becomes relevant.
        {/slide}
{slide=Time Progression}After the introductory bits, this quest will not necessarily be a single unbroken narrative. Your day to day life will continue semi-automatically until something unusual happens or you intentionally make plans of some sort. You will then ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL for the duration of these scenarios, after which you can vote on what plans to make.

Well, technically that will be true from day 1, it's just that you'll be having a lot of unusual days in the near future such that I won't bother breaking things up until there are no immediate crises and/or you have unlocked more playable characters.

Anyway, think of it as something like playing Persona 3 or 4, social links and all. ...of course, in PMMM when your shadow archetype goes on a monstrous rampage you can't hug it into submission.
        {/slide}
{slide=Recruiting}While Yui is "you", the Designated Magical Girl Protagonist Full Of Love And Kindness And Yuri, you will have the option to get inside the head of other characters once--to continue the Persona comparison--their Social Link with Yui is high enough.

There are four general levels of cooperation you can have with other magical girls. Improving your social relationship with a magical girl makes it possible to suggest increasing your level of cooperation. For girls local to Nagamioka that's all you need; for girls in other areas there may be other restrictions. In particular, any girls belonging to a territory-holding group can't have a higher cooperation level than their group's leader does. And of course, these are reciprocal relationships, so assume that you'll also treat them as described.
Neutral: You coexist peacefully with each other and can negotiate temporary alliances. You can enter their territory safely as long as you don't hunt there. They may or may not be interested in hanging out socially, but they don't actively dislike you.
Friendly: Will be open to cooperation in general without a special agreement. Won't mind if you take out witches in their territory if you're already there and will come to your aid in an emergency.
Allies: You fight together often, share a single territory, and probably see each other socially on a regular basis.
Teammates: You trust each other fully and work toward the same goals. Your mundane friends probably suspect you're dating.
From an OOC and gameplay standpoint, moving from allies to teammates means that the other girl trusts Yui enough that I won't feel any need to keep details about the other character hidden for gameplay reasons. As such, any meguca with a social link at "Teammate" level will be considered a playable character and you can vote at any point to play a particular scene from their perspective instead of Yui's, including scenes where Yui isn't even present.

An exception to the "limited by leader" rule may be made for specific characters if you're fully allied with another team and girls other than the leader are moved to "Teammate" status.
        {/slide}
    [/tabs]{/slide}


    {slide=Character Mechanics}[tabs=Character Mechanics|100%x420]
{slide=Corruption and Emotional State}Handling corruption and grief seeds will, at least for now, work roughly the way it does in [post=4451632]Memento Mori[/post], with the caveat that maximum capacity in this quest will not necessarily be tied directly to meguca potential/witch difficulty. Certain characters may have certain abilities that complicate things further.

Mechanically, a "grief spiral" describes a feedback loop of sustained emotional agitation. This can still be fairly slow; it just means that the character is accumulating corruption over time at a steady rate. Aside from grief spirals and certain flavors of wish magic, baseline corruption accumulation is too small compared to other sources to bother tracking.
        {/slide}
{slide=Numeric Stats}There are three core numeric stats, each of which encompass a wide range of personality traits and tendencies. Note that these are specifically personality stats, rather than a reflection of intrinsic ability--they describe the choices a character generally makes, not a hard limit on what they're capable of.

Heart is a measure of empathy, emotional resilience, and strength of emotional motivations. Having a high Heart stat means better understanding of what NPCs feel and how they'll react, recovering more quickly from emotional trauma, and makes it easier to build friendships.

Narratively, if your perspective character has a high Heart stat (e.g., Yui) you'll get a lot more--and more accurate--hints about what NPCs are thinking/feeling, how they might react, and what the consequences of social actions may be.

Mind is a measure of intuition, perceptiveness, general intelligence, and strength of abstract motivations. Having a high Mind stat means noticing more important details, drawing more accurate conclusions, and makes it easier to create and execute plans.

Narratively, if your perspective character has a high Mind stat (e.g., Maiko) you'll get more hints about the overall situation, more attention to minor details that may be important, and more tactically sophisticated suggested vote options.

Will is a measure of determination, willpower, courage, and self-confidence. Having a high Will stat means being more resistant to physical and mental fatigue, staying clear-headed at high corruption levels, and generally refusing to be broken by the meguca system. Veteran meguca all have an above-average Will stat, either because they started that way or because years of meguca life are a painfully effective way to grind that stat up.

Narratively, if your perspective character has a high Will stat (e.g., Asami) you'll be able to make difficult or unpleasant choices without needing die rolls and will have a significant advantage in battle-of-wills magic such as resisting mental effects.
        {/slide}
{slide=Axiom Rules}Each (playable) character will have a specially designated personality trait, motivation, or idea which I will arbitrarily refer to as their "Axiom", on account of words spelled with an 'x' sounding cooler and needing some term I can use without ambiguity. The Axiom represents something fundamental about the character's mindset. Their nature, you might even say.

The gameplay consequences are as follows:
Attempting actions that go too heavily against a character's Axiom may require die rolls based on their willpower.
Rationalizing away the conflict can also work, but will cause even greater backlash if confronted with holes in your "logic" later.
Even at very high corruption levels or when subject to mind-altering magic, actions that exemplify the Axiom will never require dice rolls to attempt--if the character's mental state is impaired enough for that, it's impaired enough that you won't be controlling the character at all.
Actions that strongly align with their Axiom will improve the character's mental state, e.g.:
Reducing or even nullifying corruption gains from sources other than magic use
A chance to break out of a grief spiral
Actions that strongly oppose their Axiom will harm the character's mental state, e.g.:
Increased corruption gains from sources other than magic use
Or even spontaneously added corruption for no other reason at all
May trigger a grief spiral even at lower corruption levels
If an internal conflict arises due to conflicting ways to satisfy their Axiom, the negative results take priority, though the severity may be reduced.
Major life events, fundamental decisions, or deep self-reflection can result in a character's Axiom shifting, to reflect their altered priorities.
Characters with strong internal conflicts may have multiple Axioms.
If they conflict, the negative effects again take priority. Because this is PMMM.
Finally, and most importantly: You will be informed in advance if any of the above applies to a provided option. If a winning write-in would risk triggering the negative effects described above, I will say so and give you additional time to reconsider the vote, if desired.

It is entirely possible to end up in situations where the only available options are compromising by acting against the character's Axiom or biting the bullet and letting something else bad happen instead. Getting boxed into situations like this is a quick way to end up dead and/or witched out--in other words, try not to sayaka yourself plzkthx.

Lacking the Witch's true name, Maiko is unable to find it in her grimoire, but the fragments of information she has found are sufficient to convince her of the Witch's existence. 

Despite extensive research, Maiko has been unable to find any pattern to its recorded appearances and thus cannot predict when it may appear again. Discovering the truth of this legendary Witch is a question that has vexed Maiko for years.

For some reason, Maiko refuses to refer to this Witch by its most common appellation...?

[SPOILER="Locations"]
All locations here are either entirely fictional, or differ significantly from their real-life counterparts. Don't see much need to add descriptions of places that you could look up on Wikipedia...

[SPOILER="Nagamioka"]
A sprawling city encompassing most of the eastern tip of Saitama prefecture. One of the largest cities in Japan and the northernmost part of the Kanto major metro area. To the east are smaller cities in Chiba prefecture; to the south is Tokyo.

Nagamioka is an active, healthy city but hasn't seen much economic growth in recent years compared to the rest of the metro area, especially the rapidly growing, high-technology economic hub centered in Kanagawa Prefecture.
[/SPOILER]
[SPOILER="Yokosuka Institute of Science and Technology"]
The school Kaoru Aikawa attends.

After rising to prominence in the 1980s, this school became the seed from which the on-going and world-famous Kanagawa technology renaissance grew, and it remains the nerve center of the technology hub that's grown through south-east Kanagawa Prefecture.

It's very shiny.

Shockwave: A light omnidirectional pulse of magic. Not very damaging, but will knock loose objects and people away from Yui. Costs 2-10 corruption depending on power level. Can break open a barrier entrance allowing non-magical girls to cross freely, because Yui apparently finds it easier to metaphorically kick down a Witch's door rather than figure out how the doorknob works...
Magic Beam: A narrow blast of raw magic, persisting for a few seconds. Makes simple inanimate objects explode, but anything containing its own magic will be sliced cleanly, if not blocking the beam entirely. Costs 2-10 corruption depending on power level.
Beam Spam: Dozens of simultaneous Magic Beam attacks at various angles and rotating in different directions. Covers a cone spanning 25 degrees or so. Small, agile, and/or distant targets may be able to dodge, but almost anything else will take at least a glancing blow. Costs 30-80 corruption, depending on power level.
Beam Cannon: A Magic Beam with more beam and way more magic. Anything without heavy magic shielding will be nigh-instantly vaporized. Costs 200-1000 corruption, depending on beam width, at roughly 1mm per point of corruption. Higher power levels would be possible, but at that point the beam is wider than Yui is tall and it becomes too hard to control. At full power, will destroy most Witches in a single shot.
Fancy Tricks and Interesting Possibilities

Power Grab: Yui seems to have some ability to take control of existing power in some abstract sense. The details and limits are unknown. So far she's successfully stolen a Witch's power to control Witch Kissed humans, an ability she intends to develop further even though using it feels really creepy.

You might feel bad about bugging her with lots of questions but you're pretty sure she enjoys explaining things to anyone who'll listen.
You kinda worry about her a little bit though. It seems like she was in a really bad place before you met her and while she seems okay now you're suspicious she's got a lot of pain and loneliness she's hiding.

Magic Abilities

Information Retrieval: Can obtain information about various topics. What kind of information and the means by which she does so are currently unknown. Corruption cost depends on what information she's after.
Iron Grave: Summons a swarm of magic chains out of nowhere to wrap and bind the target, immobilizing them. (1 MP)

???: Creates a swarm of flying sickle blades up to 25 meters away, which fly toward Maiko and disappear just before reaching her, or sooner if she prefers. (1 MP)
???: Temporary magic effect that allows controlled flight and levitation. (1 MP when transformed; 2 MP otherwise, or if used on someone else)
???: Temporary magic effect that allows limited control of raw destructive magic, either formed into a melee weapon attached to her hand or fired as projectiles. Destruction magic appears as a mixture of black smoke and green lightning. (1 MP when transformed; 2 MP otherwise)

(NO PICTURE) A magical girl in south-east Nagamioka. Her territory borders yours to the northwest, Chiba prefecture to the east, and Tokyo's Adachi and Katsushika wards to the south. She was driven out of her home in Tokyo by a group there and planned to continue on to Yokohama or Kazamino, but decided to claim part of Nagamioka when the opportunity arrived.
She seems kinda prickly and stubborn and is reflexively distrustful of everything to the point of near paranoia. As frustrating as it was to talk to her, the worst part is that from what Maiko says about Tokyo she probably has good reasons for being the way she is...
Her costume looks like a stereotypical delinquent outfit with a decorative flower motif and she fights viciously with two spiked clubs. She also has some sort of magic that's probably related to plants because she could summon vines to trap a Witch... actually now that you think about it, those spikes on her clubs even looked like rose thorns.

She's one of the best soccer players in the school and you love watching her games to see her in action. She gets a lot of attention from other girls in your class... you've caught a few jealous looks thrown your way which you think is totally unfair because you're just friends and also you're preeeetty sure Natsuki isn't into girls anyway on account of never once catching her checking out her teammates despite how awesome soccer shorts are.

She's planning to run for student council president next year and you think she might just win.
Honestly, she's the one person you might feel a bit jealous of. Without any of your advantages she's done more than you ever have, and did so running on little more than ambition and sheer audacity. But she's Natsuki's friend and seems nice, so you can't really dislike her.

The two of you have been very close for years. Your parents are nice people, but they tend to be strict, a bit old-fashioned, and more than a bit emotionally distant, so for most of your childhood your brother was the one who'd be there for you when you needed something.
When your parents started making disapproving faces at your precocious not-quite-teenage antics Kaoru often ended up "stuck" watching you in order to be a "good influence", which usually meant him aiding and abetting you and your friends in all manner of not-parentally-sanctioned shenanigans.

Ludum Machinae
that's "game mechanics" in very dubious Latin fyi
The first law of this quest: I AM THE LAW.
...by which I mean that gameplay mechanics exist to smooth things out and let you know what to expect. I will disregard them if necessary for the sake of common sense or a better narrative, but most of the rules will be loose enough in the first place that it probably won't be an issue. I may also ignore crunchy gameplay stuff entirely for scenes where I'm pretty sure the outcome would be the same regardless.
[tabs=Game Mechanics|100%x520]
{slide=General Gameplay}[tabs=General Gameplay|100%x420]
{slide=Things What Happen}There are basically five types of decision that will come up in this quest:
Simple Fluff: The decisions you make will have minor long-term impact, mostly determining what happens in the next update, most of which will probably be silly.
Social Minefields: The decisions you make will have potentially large consequences for how you interact with the other characters involved in the future. What happens will be primarily a matter of whether you can figure out what the other characters want and are motivated by. Dice will be used rarely if at all, and only for things like "does the character have the courage and/or willpower to do what the vote says".
Combat: The decisions you make will, obviously, determine the outcome of the battle. Combat will generally be resolved narratively if a plan is provided that relies only on established abilities that have a guaranteed result. Combat that boils down to "hit bad girl with thing what makes ouchies" will probably be resolved with dice, as will attempts to use improvised techniques or ones that don't have a guaranteed outcome for other reasons.
Exploration and Training: The decisions you make will provide information or improve the character's abilities in various ways, but with no other immediate impact. Note that a character's skill at a task will improve if and only if the margin of success/failure was small--overwhelming failure or success won't teach the character anything about what works or not.
Long-term planning: When there are no immediate crises, you'll instead vote on high-level plans of what Yui and friends should do over a specified period of time. I'll explain this better once the Quest gets to the point where it becomes relevant.
{/slide}
{slide=Time Progression}After the introductory bits, this quest will not necessarily be a single unbroken narrative. Your day to day life will continue semi-automatically until something unusual happens or you intentionally make plans of some sort. You will then ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL for the duration of these scenarios, after which you can vote on what plans to make.
Well, technically that will be true from day 1, it's just that you'll be having a lot of unusual days in the near future such that I won't bother breaking things up until there are no immediate crises and/or you have unlocked more playable characters.
Anyway, think of it as something like playing Persona 3 or 4, social links and all. ...of course, in PMMM when your shadow archetype goes on a monstrous rampage you can't hug it into submission.
{/slide}
{slide=Recruiting}While Yui is "you", the Designated Magical Girl Protagonist Full Of Love And Kindness And Yuri, you will have the option to get inside the head of other characters once--to continue the Persona comparison--their Social Link with Yui is high enough.
There are four general levels of cooperation you can have with other magical girls. Improving your social relationship with a magical girl makes it possible to suggest increasing your level of cooperation. For girls local to Nagamioka that's all you need; for girls in other areas there may be other restrictions. In particular, any girls belonging to a territory-holding group can't have a higher cooperation level than their group's leader does. And of course, these are reciprocal relationships, so assume that you'll also treat them as described.
Neutral: You coexist peacefully with each other and can negotiate temporary alliances. You can enter their territory safely as long as you don't hunt there. They may or may not be interested in hanging out socially, but they don't actively dislike you.
Friendly: Will be open to cooperation in general without a special agreement. Won't mind if you take out witches in their territory if you're already there and will come to your aid in an emergency.
Allies: You fight together often, share a single territory, and probably see each other socially on a regular basis.
Teammates: You trust each other fully and work toward the same goals. Your mundane friends probably suspect you're dating.
From an OOC and gameplay standpoint, moving from allies to teammates means that the other girl trusts Yui enough that I won't feel any need to keep details about the other character hidden for gameplay reasons. As such, any meguca with a social link at "Teammate" level will be considered a playable character and you can vote at any point to play a particular scene from their perspective instead of Yui's, including scenes where Yui isn't even present.
An exception to the "limited by leader" rule may be made for specific characters if you're fully allied with another team and girls other than the leader are moved to "Teammate" status.
{/slide}
[/tabs]{/slide}

{slide=Character Mechanics}[tabs=Character Mechanics|100%x420]
{slide=Corruption and Emotional State}Handling corruption and grief seeds will, at least for now, work roughly the way it does in [post=4451632]Memento Mori[/post], with the caveat that maximum capacity in this quest will not necessarily be tied directly to meguca potential/witch difficulty. Certain characters may have certain abilities that complicate things further.
Mechanically, a "grief spiral" describes a feedback loop of sustained emotional agitation. This can still be fairly slow; it just means that the character is accumulating corruption over time at a steady rate. Aside from grief spirals and certain flavors of wish magic, baseline corruption accumulation is too small compared to other sources to bother tracking.
{/slide}
{slide=Numeric Stats}There are three core numeric stats, each of which encompass a wide range of personality traits and tendencies. Note that these are specifically personality stats, rather than a reflection of intrinsic ability--they describe the choices a character generally makes, not a hard limit on what they're capable of.
Heart is a measure of empathy, emotional resilience, and strength of emotional motivations. Having a high Heart stat means better understanding of what NPCs feel and how they'll react, recovering more quickly from emotional trauma, and makes it easier to build friendships.
Narratively, if your perspective character has a high Heart stat (e.g., Yui) you'll get a lot more--and more accurate--hints about what NPCs are thinking/feeling, how they might react, and what the consequences of social actions may be.
Mind is a measure of intuition, perceptiveness, general intelligence, and strength of abstract motivations. Having a high Mind stat means noticing more important details, drawing more accurate conclusions, and makes it easier to create and execute plans.
Narratively, if your perspective character has a high Mind stat (e.g., Maiko) you'll get more hints about the overall situation, more attention to minor details that may be important, and more tactically sophisticated suggested vote options.
Will is a measure of determination, willpower, courage, and self-confidence. Having a high Will stat means being more resistant to physical and mental fatigue, staying clear-headed at high corruption levels, and generally refusing to be broken by the meguca system. Veteran meguca all have an above-average Will stat, either because they started that way or because years of meguca life are a painfully effective way to grind that stat up.
Narratively, if your perspective character has a high Will stat (e.g., Asami) you'll be able to make difficult or unpleasant choices without needing die rolls and will have a significant advantage in battle-of-wills magic such as resisting mental effects.
{/slide}
{slide=Axiom Rules}Each (playable) character will have a specially designated personality trait, motivation, or idea which I will arbitrarily refer to as their "Axiom", on account of words spelled with an 'x' sounding cooler and needing some term I can use without ambiguity. The Axiom represents something fundamental about the character's mindset. Their nature, you might even say.
The gameplay consequences are as follows:
Attempting actions that go too heavily against a character's Axiom may require die rolls based on their willpower.
Rationalizing away the conflict can also work, but will cause even greater backlash if confronted with holes in your "logic" later.
Even at very high corruption levels or when subject to mind-altering magic, actions that exemplify the Axiom will never require dice rolls to attempt--if the character's mental state is impaired enough for that, it's impaired enough that you won't be controlling the character at all.
Actions that strongly align with their Axiom will improve the character's mental state, e.g.:
Reducing or even nullifying corruption gains from sources other than magic use
A chance to break out of a grief spiral
Actions that strongly oppose their Axiom will harm the character's mental state, e.g.:
Increased corruption gains from sources other than magic use
Or even spontaneously added corruption for no other reason at all
May trigger a grief spiral even at lower corruption levels
If an internal conflict arises due to conflicting ways to satisfy their Axiom, the negative results take priority, though the severity may be reduced.
Major life events, fundamental decisions, or deep self-reflection can result in a character's Axiom shifting, to reflect their altered priorities.
Characters with strong internal conflicts may have multiple Axioms.
If they conflict, the negative effects again take priority. Because this is PMMM.
Finally, and most importantly: You will be informed in advance if any of the above applies to a provided option. If a winning write-in would risk triggering the negative effects described above, I will say so and give you additional time to reconsider the vote, if desired.
It is entirely possible to end up in situations where the only available options are compromising by acting against the character's Axiom or biting the bullet and letting something else bad happen instead. Getting boxed into situations like this is a quick way to end up dead and/or witched out--in other words, try not to sayaka yourself plzkthx.

Axiom rule: Desires to help people and keep them safe, both physically and emotionally. Positive effects apply when comforting someone, rescuing people, or planning/attempting to do those; negative effects apply when hurting others even if it's the only option, or when seriously considering someone getting hurt because of her.
Inherent Abilities

Magic Perception: Yui can perceive magical power. She's not sure what all the details and differences mean, or whether she can see only certain kinds of magic, but she can recognize humans and barrier entrances. Large concentrations of power or anything at too much of a distance becomes an indistinct blur and all she can tell is roughly how much magic is present. Physical Boosts: Yui's wish gives her physical enhancements well above most magical girls. So far she's discovered that:
She can jump well over 30m straight up, and probably closer to 50m.
She can smash flying boulders with her face.
Magic Abilities

Shockwave: A light omnidirectional pulse of magic. Not very damaging, but will knock loose objects and people away from Yui. Costs 2-10 corruption depending on power level. Can break open a barrier entrance allowing non-magical girls to cross freely, because Yui apparently finds it easier to metaphorically kick down a Witch's door rather than figure out how the doorknob works...
Magic Beam: A narrow blast of raw magic, persisting for a few seconds. Makes simple inanimate objects explode, but anything containing its own magic will be sliced cleanly, if not blocking the beam entirely. Costs 2-10 corruption depending on power level.
Beam Spam: Dozens of simultaneous Magic Beam attacks at various angles and rotating in different directions. Covers a cone spanning 25 degrees or so. Small, agile, and/or distant targets may be able to dodge, but almost anything else will take at least a glancing blow. Costs 30-80 corruption, depending on power level.
Beam Cannon: A Magic Beam with more beam and way more magic. Anything without heavy magic shielding will be nigh-instantly vaporized. Costs 200-1000 corruption, depending on beam width, at roughly 1mm per point of corruption. Higher power levels would be possible, but at that point the beam is wider than Yui is tall and it becomes too hard to control. At full power, will destroy most Witches in a single shot.
Fancy Tricks and Interesting Possibilities

Power Grab: Yui seems to have some ability to take control of existing power in some abstract sense. The details and limits are unknown. So far she's successfully stolen a Witch's power to control Witch Kissed humans, an ability she intends to develop further even though using it feels really creepy.

{slide=Chou Minamori / 皆森 蝶}
(NO PICTURE) A magical girl in south-east Nagamioka. Her territory borders yours to the northwest, Chiba prefecture to the east, and Tokyo's Adachi and Katsushika wards to the south. She was driven out of her home in Tokyo by a group there and planned to continue on to Yokohama or Kazamino, but decided to claim part of Nagamioka when the opportunity arrived.
She seems kinda prickly and stubborn and is reflexively distrustful of everything to the point of near paranoia. As frustrating as it was to talk to her, the worst part is that from what Maiko says about Tokyo she probably has good reasons for being the way she is...
Her costume looks like a stereotypical delinquent outfit with a decorative flower motif and she fights viciously with two spiked clubs. She also has some sort of magic that's probably related to plants because she could summon vines to trap a Witch... actually now that you think about it, those spikes on her clubs even looked like rose thorns. You wonder what else she can do...

(NO PICTURE) Your best friend since childhood!
Natsuki is a total jock and really sweet and also kind of a crybaby. You worry about her sometimes, that she might be a little too emotionally dependent on you, but... she's your friend so it's not like you could abandon her when she needs support, right?
She's one of the best soccer players in the school and you love watching her games to see her in action. She gets a lot of attention from other girls in your class... you've caught a few jealous looks thrown your way which you think is totally unfair because you're just friends and also you're preeeetty sure Natsuki isn't into girls anyway on account of never once catching her checking out her teammates despite how awesome soccer shorts are.
Age: 13
Height: 165cm
Hair: Yellow, bangs pushed up and back in haphazard spikes, the rest tied into a short braid.

{slide=Asami Amano / 天野 朝望}
(NO PICTURE) Another classmate. You don't know her all that well, but she hangs out with Natsuki a lot so you talk to her regularly.
Asami is a proud and driven girl with a chronically ornery and uncooperative temperament. Somehow ended up as the student council VP despite being the terror of authority figures everywhere and is surprisingly successful and well-liked for it. She's planning to run for student council president next year and you think she might just win.
Honestly, she's the one person you might feel a bit jealous of. Without any of your advantages she's done more than you ever have, and did so running on little more than ambition and sheer audacity. But she's Natsuki's friend and seems nice, so you can't really dislike her.
Anyway, she's cool and you definitely wouldn't mind getting to know her better. Ahem.

{slide=Kaoru Aikawa / 哀川 郁}
(NO PICTURE) Your big brother. He's in his first year at a fancy university in another city and visits occasionally, maybe once a month or so.
The two of you have been very close for years. Your parents are nice people, but they tend to be strict, a bit old-fashioned, and more than a bit emotionally distant, so for most of your childhood your brother was the one who'd be there for you when you needed something.
When your parents started making disapproving faces at your precocious not-quite-teenage antics Kaoru often ended up "stuck" watching you in order to be a "good influence", which usually meant him aiding and abetting you and your friends in all manner of not-parentally-sanctioned shenanigans.
Basically he's a real bro, in every sense.

Ludum Machinae
that's "game mechanics" in very dubious Latin fyi
The first law of this quest: I AM THE LAW.
...by which I mean that gameplay mechanics exist to smooth things out and let you know what to expect. I will disregard them if necessary for the sake of common sense or a better narrative, but most of the rules will be loose enough in the first place that it probably won't be an issue. I may also ignore crunchy gameplay stuff entirely for scenes where I'm pretty sure the outcome would be the same regardless.
[tabs=Game Mechanics|100%x520]
{slide=General Gameplay}[tabs=General Gameplay|100%x420]
{slide=Things What Happen}There are basically five types of decision that will come up in this quest:
Simple Fluff: The decisions you make will have minor long-term impact, mostly determining what happens in the next update, most of which will probably be silly.
Social Minefields: The decisions you make will have potentially large consequences for how you interact with the other characters involved in the future. What happens will be primarily a matter of whether you can figure out what the other characters want and are motivated by. Dice will be used rarely if at all, and only for things like "does the character have the courage and/or willpower to do what the vote says".
Combat: The decisions you make will, obviously, determine the outcome of the battle. Combat will generally be resolved narratively if a plan is provided that relies only on established abilities that have a guaranteed result. Combat that boils down to "hit bad girl with thing what makes ouchies" will probably be resolved with dice, as will attempts to use improvised techniques or ones that don't have a guaranteed outcome for other reasons.
Exploration and Training: The decisions you make will provide information or improve the character's abilities in various ways, but with no other immediate impact. Note that a character's skill at a task will improve if and only if the margin of success/failure was small--overwhelming failure or success won't teach the character anything about what works or not.
Long-term planning: When there are no immediate crises, you'll instead vote on high-level plans of what Yui and friends should do over a specified period of time. I'll explain this better once the Quest gets to the point where it becomes relevant.
{/slide}
{slide=Time Progression}After the introductory bits, this quest will not necessarily be a single unbroken narrative. Your day to day life will continue semi-automatically until something unusual happens or you intentionally make plans of some sort. You will then ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL for the duration of these scenarios, after which you can vote on what plans to make.
Well, technically that will be true from day 1, it's just that you'll be having a lot of unusual days in the near future such that I won't bother breaking things up until there are no immediate crises and/or you have unlocked more playable characters.
Anyway, think of it as something like playing Persona 3 or 4, social links and all. ...of course, in PMMM when your shadow archetype goes on a monstrous rampage you can't hug it into submission.
{/slide}
{slide=Recruiting}While Yui is "you", the Designated Magical Girl Protagonist Full Of Love And Kindness And Yuri, you will have the option to get inside the head of other characters once--to continue the Persona comparison--their Social Link with Yui is high enough.
There are four general levels of cooperation you can have with other magical girls. Improving your social relationship with a magical girl makes it possible to suggest increasing your level of cooperation. For girls local to Nagamioka that's all you need; for girls in other areas there may be other restrictions. In particular, any girls belonging to a territory-holding group can't have a higher cooperation level than their group's leader does. And of course, these are reciprocal relationships, so assume that you'll also treat them as described.
Neutral: You coexist peacefully with each other and can negotiate temporary alliances. You can enter their territory safely as long as you don't hunt there. They may or may not be interested in hanging out socially, but they don't actively dislike you.
Friendly: Will be open to cooperation in general without a special agreement. Won't mind if you take out witches in their territory if you're already there and will come to your aid in an emergency.
Allies: You fight together often, share a single territory, and probably see each other socially on a regular basis.
Teammates: You trust each other fully and work toward the same goals. Your mundane friends probably suspect you're dating.
From an OOC and gameplay standpoint, moving from allies to teammates means that the other girl trusts Yui enough that I won't feel any need to keep details about the other character hidden for gameplay reasons. As such, any meguca with a social link at "Teammate" level will be considered a playable character and you can vote at any point to play a particular scene from their perspective instead of Yui's, including scenes where Yui isn't even present.
An exception to the "limited by leader" rule may be made for specific characters if you're fully allied with another team and girls other than the leader are moved to "Teammate" status.

[/tabs]{/slide}

{slide=Character Mechanics}[tabs=Character Mechanics|100%x420]
{slide=Corruption and Emotional State}Handling corruption and grief seeds will, at least for now, work roughly the way it does in [post=4451632]Memento Mori[/post], with the caveat that maximum capacity in this quest will not necessarily be tied directly to meguca potential/witch difficulty. Certain characters may have certain abilities that complicate things further.
Mechanically, a "grief spiral" describes a feedback loop of sustained emotional agitation. This can still be fairly slow; it just means that the character is accumulating corruption over time at a steady rate. Aside from grief spirals and certain flavors of wish magic, baseline corruption accumulation is too small compared to other sources to bother tracking.
{/slide}
{slide=Numeric Stats}There are three core numeric stats, each of which encompass a wide range of personality traits and tendencies. Note that these are specifically personality stats, rather than a reflection of intrinsic ability--they describe the choices a character generally makes, not a hard limit on what they're capable of.
Heart is a measure of empathy, emotional resilience, and strength of emotional motivations. Having a high Heart stat means better understanding of what NPCs feel and how they'll react, recovering more quickly from emotional trauma, and makes it easier to build friendships.
Narratively, if your perspective character has a high Heart stat (e.g., Yui) you'll get a lot more--and more accurate--hints about what NPCs are thinking/feeling, how they might react, and what the consequences of social actions may be.
Mind is a measure of intuition, perceptiveness, general intelligence, and strength of abstract motivations. Having a high Mind stat means noticing more important details, drawing more accurate conclusions, and makes it easier to create and execute plans.
Narratively, if your perspective character has a high Mind stat (e.g., Maiko) you'll get more hints about the overall situation, more attention to minor details that may be important, and more tactically sophisticated suggested vote options.
Will is a measure of determination, willpower, courage, and self-confidence. Having a high Will stat means being more resistant to physical and mental fatigue, staying clear-headed at high corruption levels, and generally refusing to be broken by the meguca system. Veteran meguca all have an above-average Will stat, either because they started that way or because years of meguca life are a painfully effective way to grind that stat up.
Narratively, if your perspective character has a high Will stat (e.g., Asami) you'll be able to make difficult or unpleasant choices without needing die rolls and will have a significant advantage in battle-of-wills magic such as resisting mental effects.
{/slide}
{slide=Axiom Rules}Each (playable) character will have a specially designated personality trait, motivation, or idea which I will arbitrarily refer to as their "Axiom", on account of words spelled with an 'x' sounding cooler and needing some term I can use without ambiguity. The Axiom represents something fundamental about the character's mindset. Their nature, you might even say.
The gameplay consequences are as follows:
Attempting actions that go too heavily against a character's Axiom may require die rolls based on their willpower.
Rationalizing away the conflict can also work, but will cause even greater backlash if confronted with holes in your "logic" later.
Even at very high corruption levels or when subject to mind-altering magic, actions that exemplify the Axiom will never require dice rolls to attempt--if the character's mental state is impaired enough for that, it's impaired enough that you won't be controlling the character at all.
Actions that strongly align with their Axiom will improve the character's mental state, e.g.:
Reducing or even nullifying corruption gains from sources other than magic use
A chance to break out of a grief spiral
Actions that strongly oppose their Axiom will harm the character's mental state, e.g.:
Increased corruption gains from sources other than magic use
Or even spontaneously added corruption for no other reason at all
May trigger a grief spiral even at lower corruption levels
If an internal conflict arises due to conflicting ways to satisfy their Axiom, the negative results take priority, though the severity may be reduced.
Major life events, fundamental decisions, or deep self-reflection can result in a character's Axiom shifting, to reflect their altered priorities.
Characters with strong internal conflicts may have multiple Axioms.
If they conflict, the negative effects again take priority. Because this is PMMM.
Finally, and most importantly: You will be informed in advance if any of the above applies to a provided option. If a winning write-in would risk triggering the negative effects described above, I will say so and give you additional time to reconsider the vote, if desired.
It is entirely possible to end up in situations where the only available options are compromising by acting against the character's Axiom or biting the bullet and letting something else bad happen instead. Getting boxed into situations like this is a quick way to end up dead and/or witched out--in other words, try not to sayaka yourself plzkthx.

For some reason, Maiko refuses to refer to this Witch by its most common appellation...?
